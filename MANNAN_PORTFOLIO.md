## About

I am a multi-disciplinary engineer, leader, and student. I'm passionate about success through effective practice, strong communication, and asymmetric risk taking.

I grew through a career of tight teams in fast-paced initiatives. I've had experience building unique products in a range of environments, from non-profits to government and commercial.

I measure my success by the strength of those around me. My greatest passion is to distill the simple from the complex, and to find flow and trust within my teams.

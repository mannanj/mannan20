# Mannan Portfolio

Full-stack portfolio with Angular 20 frontend, Spring Boot backend, and real-time cursor tracking.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular 20, NgRx, Signals, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.5.6, Java 25
- **Features**: WebSocket cursor tracking, Vercel Analytics

## Quick Start

Run frontend and WebSocket server in separate terminals:
```bash
./run.sh
```

Or run services individually:

Frontend (http://localhost:4200):
```bash
npm start
```

Backend (http://localhost:8080):
```bash
cd backend && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

WebSocket Server:
```bash
npm run ws-server
```

## Setup

After cloning the repository, run the setup script to configure git hooks:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This enables the pre-commit hook that auto-generates the dev stats commit history.

## Project Structure

## Development Features

### Dev Stats

Enable the developer stats panel to view recent commit history:

1. **Set Cookie**: In your browser console, run:
   ```javascript
   document.cookie = "isMannanDev=1; path=/"
   ```

2. **View Stats**: Refresh the page and click the ðŸ“Š icon in the bottom-left corner

3. **What You'll See**:
   - Last 9 git commits
   - Commit hash (linked to GitHub)
   - Commit subject and author
   - Commit date

**Note**: The dev-commits.json and tasks.json files are auto-generated by a git post-commit hook (`.githooks/post-commit`) and update on every commit.

## Git Workflow for Task Management

This project uses an automated task tracking system integrated with git commits.

### Working with Tasks

1. **Add tasks to `tasks.md`** using this format:
   ```markdown
   ### Task N: Task Title
   - [ ] Subtask description
   - Location: `file/path`
   ```

2. **Complete tasks** by checking all subtasks:
   ```markdown
   ### Task N: Task Title
   - [x] Subtask description
   - Location: `file/path`
   ```

3. **Commit with task tag** for automatic tracking:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description [Task-N]"
   ```

The post-commit hook will:
- Detect completed tasks
- Link them to your commit
- Auto-generate updated `tasks.json` with completion dates
- Create a second commit with the updated data files

4. **Push both commits**:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

**Important**: Always include `[Task-N]` in commit messages when completing tasks for proper tracking in the dev stats panel.

## Deployment

```bash
vercel
```

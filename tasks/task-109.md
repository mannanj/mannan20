### Task 109: Implement Visx Delaunay-Voronoi Knowledge Graph
- [ ] Install Visx dependencies (@visx/delaunay, @visx/voronoi, @visx/group, @visx/responsive)
- [ ] Create knowledge-graph component in src/app/components/knowledge-graph/
- [ ] Create knowledge data model with node types (skill, project, article, hobby, etc.)
- [ ] Generate sample knowledge data with positions and metadata
- [ ] Implement Delaunay-Voronoi diagram visualization with Visx
- [ ] Add interactive hover effects to highlight Voronoi cells and display node information
- [ ] Add click handler to navigate into nodes with detailed information
- [ ] Style Voronoi cells with different colors based on node type (skill, project, article, hobby)
- [ ] Add smooth transitions and animations for cell interactions
- [ ] Create navigation breadcrumbs to track which node you're exploring
- [ ] Add back navigation to return to main Voronoi view
- [ ] Integrate knowledge graph into About section or dedicated page
- Location: Create `src/app/components/knowledge-graph/`, `src/app/models/knowledge.ts`

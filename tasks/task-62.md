### Task 62: Comprehensive CSS Overhaul and Simplification
- [x] Audit all CSS usage across codebase (global styles, component styles, inline classes)
- [x] Create responsive layout system with consistent container padding/width:
  - Mobile: 100% width with 20px padding on sides
  - Tablet (md breakpoint 768px+): 70% content width (15% margin each side)
  - Desktop (lg breakpoint 1024px+): max-width 720px, centered with auto margins
- [x] Configure Tailwind to support responsive container system
- [x] Remove all entry animations from components (fadeIn, slideInLeft, slideInRight, scaleIn, bounceIn)
- [x] Remove animation imports from all components
- [x] Simplify button interactions:
  - Remove complex pseudo-element animations (::before ripple effects)
  - Add simple scale transform on hover (scale-105)
  - Add subtle shadow glow on active/click state using box-shadow
  - Keep blue color scheme (#039be5, #4fc3f7)
- [x] Create reusable button utility classes in Tailwind for consistent styling
- [x] Consolidate extremely long inline Tailwind class strings into named CSS classes where appropriate
- [x] Remove redundant custom CSS that can be replaced with Tailwind utilities
- [x] Preserve all colors exactly: #039be5, #4fc3f7, #0b0b0b, #ffffff, #333, #666
- [x] Keep essential custom CSS:
  - Link underline animations (a::after with width transition)
  - Expandable content (.content, .collapsible)
  - Modal backdrop and animations
  - Contact page ripple circles
  - Any ::before/::after pseudo-elements with content
- [x] Apply responsive container to all main page sections (Home, About, Contact)
- [x] Test all pages at mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes
- [x] Verify visual appearance matches screenshots in public/ui-screenshots
- [x] Ensure no functionality is lost during CSS refactoring
- Location: `src/styles.css`, `src/app/animations/animations.ts`, all component files

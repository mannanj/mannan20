### Task 58: Refactor All Modals to Content-Based Sizing
- [x] Update modal component default styles to use content-based width and height
- [x] Set max-width to 728px for all modals
- [x] Set max-height to 90vh or 800px (whichever is smaller)
- [x] Ensure modals don't take up more space than their content needs
- [x] Test all modals (contact, dev-stats, etc.) to ensure proper sizing
- [x] Make sure overflow behavior works correctly when content exceeds max dimensions

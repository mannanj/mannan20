"hi as tasks i want to add these ideas: allow public contribution, those wh contribute will appear as contributors in my site, you can also add details and notes and comments to sections of my site at any time by enablign the comments mode through the command bar, adding your own contributions, your thoughts and notes on my work quality, what you know about me, asking questinos etc that inform future updates. in agentic coding mode you can add or introduce features, or implement and oversee agents to implement code features that oyu want to see. in the command bar you will be able to lunach these different modes and navigate the site. i also foresee removing the nav bat the top right and replacing it instead with teh command bar. int he command bar i also want a "mode" where i can enable features basedo on if you are a recruiter, coworker, friend, etc based on what you want to see. illa lso show the login mode to make an account where you can get access and permissions, and enter a code, which gives you access and permissions. i also have sponsor and donor modes, wehre you can special privielges, here they are: ..... i also have modes and links and docs for visitors to launch their own website with full guides, and the code fully open sourced and available non-commerically though, if you want to profit, you must work with me, and i offer consulting to help you implement your own site upon request - with donor/volunterring/low income options. i can say and list the efforts im seeking to create and seeking collaborators on: conscious objectors, sun scheduling and health and wellbeing initiative,s business partners to test and validate concepts usch as water kefir, etc etc."

### Additional Context - Internal Referral Network:

"i imagine a network of people also who we form a network of collaborators and people in the network of engineers, etc where we can view those in our network on the command bar or a section of the site as well, call this an internal referral system. maybe we have sharp visino statements of what we offer to help guide connecting with us."

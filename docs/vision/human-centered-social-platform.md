This document captures the vision for a human-centered social platform that prioritizes genuine connection, vulnerability, and meeting core human needs over profit extraction.

## Date: 2025-10-29

### Core Philosophy

The fundamental vision is to create a platform where personal websites become **private-social media spaces** that represent authentic human needs being met:

- **Connection**: Being connected with others
- **Contributing**: Making meaningful contributions
- **Finding meaning**: Discovering purpose and meaningful connections
- **Cooperation**: Collaborating with others
- **Joy, fun, good vibes**: Creating positive experiences
- **Support through service**: Giving and receiving support

### The Problem with Current Social Media

Current public social media platforms fail to meet these core human needs because:

- **Misaligned Incentives**: Social media companies extract attention through dark patterns and addictive loops to generate ad revenue
- **Insincerity & Deception**: Age of insincerity, deception, and unaccountability
- **Not Working**: Clearly not working for most of humanity

### The Solution: Private-Social Media

Move from public social media to **private social media spaces** where:

- Everyone's site is their brand and presentation of themselves
- What they are up to is shown with **radical vulnerability and honesty**
- People **ask for what they want**: support, connection, the core needs mentioned above
- Experimentation with features in personal private spaces
- **Open source, non-commercial use** to get humanity back to sincere connection and wellbeing

### Original Input:

"based on this convo lets create another raw document with the disclaimer at the top, and an equivalent task in tasks.md linking to the raw source, that i want to have my site be a place that represents the core human needs being met: connection, being connected with, contributing, finding meaning, finding meaningful connection, meaningful conversations, cooperation, joy, fun, good vibes, and generla support and giving it through service and contribution. the features that i think of ot support that are a integratino of private-social media where everyones site is a brand and presentation of themselves what they are up to, and shows vulnerability in an age of insincerity, deception,a nd unaccountability. we move forward with radical vulnerability and honesty, and ask for what we want: the support, connection, etc the things i mentinoed above. for that end i think of fun ideas im experiemnting with to seek that need when in a public space of public social media these needs are not met and clearly not working for most of uhmanity when the social media company needs are extractino of attentino through dark patterns and adictive loops meant to generate more ad revenue. our goal instead is to experiment and play with introducing those features in each persons private spaces, and to open source and introduce this code for non-commerical use only to get humanity back to sincere connetion and wellbeing."

### Experimental Features

#### 1. Live Chat with Follow-up System
- Live chat functionality
- Chat conversations saved and sent back to both parties
- Follow-up system to continue conversations
- Context preservation across sessions

#### 2. LLM-Powered Content Filtering
- LLM filtering and parsing to get the content we're looking for
- Cut through the noise
- Ask LLM to extract what matters
- Intelligent content curation

#### 3. Context-Aware Availability System

**Core Concept**: Like being at a party, context clues indicate openness to connection

**Features**:
- Built-in scheduling
- Pinging like beepers/pagers to get people's attention
- **IF** notifications are enabled AND person indicated they're open to connection
- Setting availability hours
- Being online = indicating availability
- Context clues for:
  - Open to connection
  - Busy engaging with someone else
  - Open to interruption (sometimes)
  - Not open to interruption (sometimes)
- Needs and offerings must align with what the person is focusing on/creating
- Sharing interests to help others find alignment and "spot in"

**Party Analogy**: At a party:
- Context clues indicate if someone is open to connection
- Or busy engaging with someone else
- Sometimes context clues indicate openness to interruption
- Sometimes not
- Sometimes your needs and what you offer must align with the thing they are focusing on and creating

#### 4. Sun Scheduling Integration
- "Sun and Society" concept
- Modern age sun scheduling
- Currently available at sun-taupe.vercel.app
- Integration into main platform

#### 5. Universal Messaging Platform
- Bring messaging from all places into one platform
- Start reading by **indicating interest** in a particular thing or person
- Get updates from that thing or person
- **NOT** a news feed style

**Party Analogy Contrast**:
- Traditional social media = Unable to go talk to the person or get food/punch without being forced to address everyone in a line first, or at least give them attention to discern if they're someone we want to engage
- New approach = Come knowing what we want, get that, bounce everyone else away
- OR indicate with context clues what we're looking for and they align or not

#### 6. Authentic Self-Presentation Platform
- Present ourselves honestly and sincerely
- Find the right opportunities that align with best value we can provide
- **Problem**: Hard because of noise and old traditional ways (1-pager resumes)
- **Solution**: Dump data of what we know, learned, interested in, have worked on, want to work on
- Find interested and aligned people through straightforward conversations
- **AI as the middle man and bridge** to facilitate this
- New way to interact with us via our site as our brand and private social media

#### 7. Data Ownership and Reverse Advertising
**Current Model (Bad)**:
- Data owned by private corporations and companies by default
- Contract of using their services = giving up our data
- Ads hidden in everyday use cases
- Deceptive insertion of ads while trying to connect with friends

**New Model (Good)**:
- We own our data
- We offer data when we find an offer we're interested in
- Companies who want to offer us something come to us directly
- **Honesty and sincerity first principle** rather than deception
- Ads presented with transparency rather than hidden insertion

### Key Principles

1. **Radical Vulnerability and Honesty**: Move forward with radical vulnerability in an age of insincerity
2. **Ask for What You Want**: Direct communication about needs (support, connection, etc.)
3. **Experimentation and Play**: Fun experimental features to seek core human needs
4. **Private Spaces**: Each person's private space for genuine interaction
5. **Open Source Non-Commercial**: Code available for non-commercial use to benefit humanity
6. **Collaboration Seeking**: Actively seeking collaboration on implementing these features
7. **Context Clues**: Natural social indicators like being at a party
8. **Alignment**: Matching needs with offerings and interests
9. **Data Ownership**: Users own and control their data
10. **Transparency**: Honesty and sincerity in all interactions, including advertising

### Implementation Philosophy

- Experiment in personal private spaces first
- Open source and introduce code for non-commercial use
- Goal: Get humanity back to sincere connection and wellbeing
- Each person's site = their brand and private social media
- Show what we're up to with vulnerability
- Create tools to facilitate asking for and meeting core human needs

### Next Steps

This vision document provides the philosophical foundation for developing features that support genuine human connection and wellbeing. Implementation tasks will break down these experimental features into actionable development work.

See tasks.md Task 125 for the implementation planning task linked to this vision document.
